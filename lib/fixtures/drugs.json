The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism is researching the answers to these and many other questions about alcohol.",

      "description": "Bath salts is the name given to synthetic cathinones, a class of drugs that have one or more laboratory-made chemicals similar to cathinone. Cathinone is a stimulant found naturally in the khat plant, grown in East Africa and southern Arabia. Chemically, cathinones are similar to amphetamines such as methamphetamine and to MDMA (Ecstasy or Molly). Common lab-made cathinones found in “bath salts” include 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), mephedrone (Drone, Meph, or Meow Meow), and methylone, but there are many others. These lab-made cathinones can be much stronger than the plant product and can cause harmful effects. Bath salts are usually white or brown crystal-like powder and are sold in small plastic or foil packages labeled Not for Human Consumption. They are sometimes labeled as plant food, jewelry cleaner, or phone screen cleaner. They are sold online and in drug product stores. These names or descriptions have nothing to do with the product. It’s a way for the drug makers to avoid detection by the Drug Enforcement Administration or local police. The lab-made cathinone products sold as bath salts should not be confused with products such as Epsom salts (the original bath salts) that people add to bathwater to help ease stress and relax muscles. Epsom salts are made of a mineral mixture of magnesium and sulfate. Bath salts are sometimes marketed as cheap substitutes for other drugs such as MDMA (Molly or Ecstasy) or cocaine. Methylone, a common chemical in bath salts, has been substituted for MDMA in capsules sold as Molly in some places. There is no way to know what is in a dose of bath salts other than testing it in a lab.",
